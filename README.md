ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Irene, an industrial engineer who recently developed an obsessive interest in data science! 
- Currently learning: Python (and it's application on data analytics and data science)
- I'm using GitHub as a place to gather all my projects and build a portfolio as I take programming courses.
